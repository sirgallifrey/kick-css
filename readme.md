# Kick-css

This css toolkit is havely based on [tachyons](https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons) and with [pocketgrid](http://arnaudleray.github.io/pocketgrid/) by [ArnaudLeray](https://github.com/ArnaudLeray) powering the grid.

Kick-css aims to be used both as an stand alone solution (which can be customized) and as a base to be extended by others.

It is currently on it's early stages, so use with care. Contributions are welcome :)
